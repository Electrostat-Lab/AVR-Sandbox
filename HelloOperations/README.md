### Expressions: 

> Syntax: `l-value` = `first-operand` [OPERATOR] `second-operand` ...

An operand expression consists of at least one or more operands at the `r-value`.

Operands are typed objects to be operated on, such as: `constants`, `variables`, and `return-values`.

In case of operations, the `r-value` is evaluated to the `l-value`.
----------------------
### The Standard Assignment Operator:

> Syntax: `l-value` **=** `r-value`

The standard assignment operator `=` assigns the r-value (right operands) to the l-value (left operand).

For example: 
```c
const char* debugFileName = "jme3-alloc-debug.log"; /* declare and assign the file */
```
----------------------
### The Compound Assignment Operator:

> Syntax: `l-value` [OPERATOR]= `r-value`

The compound assignment operators perform an operation involving both the `l-value` and `r-value`, and then assign the resulting expression to the `l-value`.

Here is the list of compound assignment operators and examples:
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void* args) {
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;

    x += 100; /* is the same as [x = x + 1] */
    printf("%i\n", x);

    x -= 2; /* is the same as [x = x - 1] */
    printf("%i\n", x);

    x *= y; /* is the same as [x = x * y] */
    printf("%i\n", x);

    x += 100;
    x = (x + 100) / 2; 
    printf("%i\n", x);

    char binary = 0b00000001;

    binary <<= 1; /* Left bitwise shift compound assignment operator => 0b00000001 << 1 = 0b00000010 = 2 */

    printf("%b\n", binary);

    binary >>= 1; /* Right bitwise shift compound assignment operator => 0b00000010 >> 1 = 0b00000001 = 1 */

    printf("%b\n", binary);

    binary = binary << 2; /* shifts the binary integer to the left 2 times, it's a simple assignment equivalent to the compound assignment operation [binary <<= 2] */
    
    printf("%b\n", binary);

    return 0;
}
```
```c
Output:
100
98
0
100
10
1
```
------------------------
### Incrementing and Decrementing:

> Syntax: ++[l-value]; , --[l-value]; , [l-value]++; , [l-value]--;

Both `++[l-value]` and `--[l-value]` are known as pre-fix increment and decrement respectively and they are equivalent to `l-value += 1` and `l-value -= 1`.

> Remember: `l-value += 1` is the same as `l-value = l-value + 1`.

Both `[l-value]++` and `[l-value]--` are known as post-fix increment and decrement respectively and they are equivalent to adding 1 and subtracting 1 respectively, but the value is evaluated to the `l-value` on the next-line.

For example:
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void* args) {
    int x = 5;
    printf("%d \n", x++); /* print x then increments it, x stills [5] here */
    /* x is now incremented by to be [6] */
    printf("%d \n", ++x); /* increments x then print it, x is now [7], notice this is equivalent to `x += 1` and `x = x + 1` */
    return 0;
}
```
------------------------
### Arithmetic Operators:

> Syntax: `l-value` = `1st-Operand` [OPERATOR] `2nd-Operand` [OPERATOR] ..... 

ADDITION `l-value` = `1st-Operand` [+] `2nd-Operand`: adds the 2 operands and the result is evaluated to the `l-value`.

SUBTRACTION `l-value` = `1st-Operand` [-] `2nd-Operand`: subtracts the second operand from the first and the result is evaluated to the `l-value`.

MULTIPLICATION `l-value` = `1st-Operand` [*] `2nd-Operand`: multiplies both operands and the result is evaluated to the `l-value`.

DIVISION `l-value` = `1st-Operand` [/] `2nd-Operand`: divides the first operand by the second operand and the result is evaluated to the `l-value`.

MODULUS `l-value` = `1st-Operand` [%] `2nd-Operand`: returns the remainder of dividing the first operand by the second operand and the result is evaluated to the `l-value`.

Here is an example demonstrating the arithmetic operations in C:
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void* args) {
    int n0 = 2;
    int n1 = 4;

    printf("Tests additon: %d\n", n0 + n1); /* returns 6 */
    printf("Tests subtraction: %d\n", n0 - n1); /* returns -2 */
    printf("Tests multiplication: %d\n", n0 * n1); /* returns 8 */
    printf("Tests division: %d\n", n0 / n1); /* Notice: this returns 0, because we are evaluating the result to an integer with no floating precisions */
    printf("Tests division: %f\n", ((float) n0) / n1); /* Notice: this returns 0.50000, because we are evaluating the result to a float using the typecasting evaluation */
    printf("Tests division: %f\n", n0 / ((float) n1)); /* Notice: this returns 0.50000, because we are evaluating the result to a float using the typecasting evaluation */
    printf("Tests modulus: %d\n", n0 % n1); /* returns 2, because n0 is less than n1 */

    /** How the moduluo function work under-the-hood ? */
    /**
     * Recall this equation: q = (x / d) where; q is the Quotient or the result of the division, x is the numerator and d is the denominator.
     * then ==> q . d = x
     * then ==> (q . d) + remainder = x
     * then ==> remainder = x - (q . d)
     * conclusion ==> the modulus function, f(x) = x - (q . d) 
     *
     * In cases of the division returns a real number, the remainder is always evaluated to zero, and so the modulus function....
     * Let's test the above function:
     * Recall, 4 % 2 = 0; because 4 / 2 = 2 and so remainder is zero as the number (4) can be divided equally into 2 and here we apply the above concluded function:
     *         f(x) = x - (q . d), recall, q = 4 / 2 = 2, and d = 2
     *         f(4) = 4 - (2 x 2) = 0.
     *
     * Example.(2): 7 % 4 = 2; beacause 2 cannot be divided equally into 4 pieces, and here we apply the above linear equation:
     *              f(x) = x - (q . d), recall, q = 2 / 4 = 0.5, and d = 4
     *              f(2) = 2 - (0.5 x 4) = 2 - 2 =
     * 
     */

    return 0;
}
```

> Remember: you can always utilize the arithmetic operations in compound assignment operations, but be careful as this changes the original value of the l-value.

------------------------
### Comparison Operators: 

> Syntax: `l-value` = `1st-Operand` [OPERATOR] `2nd-Operand`

The comparison operators used to compare 2 operands and returns 1 if the condition is met and 0 if the condition isn't true.

IS-NOT-EQUAL `!=`: Tests whether both operands are not equal, if this condition is met, the expression returns 1 (true), 0 otherwise.

IS-EQUAL `==`: Tests whether both operands are equal, if this condition is met, the expression returns 1 (true), 0 otherwise.

IS-GREATER-THAN-OR-EQUAL `>=`: Tests whether the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand, if this condition is met, the expression returns 1, 0 otherwise.

IS-LESS-THAN-OR-EQUAL `<=`: Tests whether the first operand is less than or equal to the second operand, if this condition is met, the expression returns 1, 0 otherwise.

IS-GREATER-THAN `>`: Tests whether the first operand is greater than the second operand, if this condition is met, the expression returns 1, 0 otherwise.

IS-LESS-THAN `<`:  Tests whether the first operand is less than the second operand, if this condition is met, the expression returns 1, 0 otherwise.

Here is an example demonstrating the comparison operators: 
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void* args) {
    int n0 = 5;
    int n1 = 5;

    printf("Tests whether 2 numbers are equal, %d\n", n0 == n1); /* returns 1 */
    printf("Tests whether 2 numbers are not equal, %d\n", n0 != n1); /* returns 0 */
    printf("Tests whether first is greater than second, %d\n", n0 > n1); /* returns 0 */
    printf("Tests whether first is greater than or equal second, %d\n", n0 >= n1); /* returns 1 */
    printf("Tests whether first is less than or equal second, %d\n", n0 <= n1); /* returns 1 */

    printf("Tests whether 3 numbers are equal, %d\n", n0 == n1 == 1); /* tests whether the return from this comparison (n0 == n1) is 1, returns 1 */
    return 0;
}
```

Using the comparison operators in conditional statements:
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void* args) {
    int n0 = 5;
    int n1 = 5;

    if (n0 == n1) { /* This executes if the conditional expression (n0 == n1) evaluates to 1 */
        printf("The 2 numbers are equal \n");
    } 
    
    if (n0 != n1) { /* This executes if the conditional expression (n0 != n1) evaluates to 1 */
        printf("The 2 numbers aren't equal \n");
    }

    if (n0 > n1) { /* This executes if the conditional expression (n0 > n1) evaluates to 1 */
        printf("The first number is greater than the second \n");
    }

    /* and so on */

    return 0;
}
```
----------------------
### Logical Operators:

> Syntax: `l-value` **=** `Expression-0` [OPERATOR] `Expression-1`

The logical operators test the truth value of a pair of operands, any non-zero expression (-1, -2, -3, ...., 1, 2, 3, 4,....) is considered true in C, while zero expressions
are considered false in C.

Logical AND `&&`: Tests whether both operands are true, if first operand is false, the condition returns with 0 (false) and the second operand isn't evaluated.

Logical OR `||`: Tests whether one of the operands is true, if the first operand is true, the condition returns with 1 (true) and the second operand isn't evaluated.

Logical NOT `!`: Flips the conditional expression, if !(1) then the expression is evaluated to 0 (means false), if !(0) then the expression is evaluated to 1 (means true).

Logical Combinatorial operators: a compound of mutiple expressions, for example: `(n0 == n1) && ((n2 < n3) && (n2 == 2))`, the most inner parenthesis is evaluated first.

Here is an example demonstrating: 
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void* args) {
    int n0 = 5;
    int n1 = 5;

    int n2 = 6;
    int n3 = 8;

    /** The logical AND operator */
    printf("Tests the truth value of a pair of operands: %d\n", (n0 == n1) && (n2 < n3)); /* returns 1 as both conditions evaluate to 1 */
    /* notice: in this case the first expression is false, so the second expression is not evaluated and the l-value is evaluated to zero */
    printf("Tests the logical AND when the first operand is [false]: %d\n", (n0 != n1) && ((n2 / 0) == 0)); /* returns 0, as the first operand evaluates to zero */
    /** Logical AND ends */

    /** The logical OR operator */
    printf("Tests the truth value of a pair of operands: %d\n", (n0 != n1) || (n2 < n3)); /* returns 1 as the second operand here evaluates to 1 */
    /* Notice: in this case the first expression is true, so the second expression is not evaluated and the l-value is evaluated to the return of the first condition (1) */
    printf("Tests the logical OR when the first operand is [true]: %d\n", (n0 == n1) || ((n2 / 0) == 0)); /* returns 1 as the first operand here evaluates to 1 */
    /** Logical OR ends */

    /** The logical NOT operator */
    printf("Tests the NOT operator: %d\n", !((n0 != n1) || (n2 < n3))); /* returns 0, as the evaluation is flipped ! */
    /* Notice the different, in this case, the internal n0 != n1 is evaluated first and then the NOT is applied to this conditional expression ... */
    printf("Tests the NOT operator on the first operand: %d\n", !(n0 != n1) || (n2 < n3)); /* returns 1, as the l-value is evaluated to the first condition */
    /** Logical NOT operator ends */

    /** TASK: Create 2 integers (n0, n1) such that n0 equals n1 and test this code: 
     *
     * printf("Test Logical AND: %d\n", (n0 != n1) && n0++); /* Remember: the AND logic gates need both operands to evaluate to true; if one of th*/
     * printf("Print n = %d\n", n0);
     * printf("Test Logical OR: %d\n", (n0 == n1) || ++n1);
     * printf("Print n = %d\n", n1);
     * 
     * Notice the increment and the decrement expressions are not evaluated in this example; because the logical expressions search for satisfaction, which when met, the    l-value evaluates and the condition returns.
     */

    return 0;
}

### Bitwise Logical Operators:

> Syntax: `l-value` **=** `Expression-0` [OPERATOR] `Expression-1`

## 4) Bitwise operations:

- Logical operations:

| `Gate` | `Notation` | `Maths Notation` | `Usage` | `Boolean Expression` |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| AND | `(...&...)` | `Q = A . B` | Mulitplying 2 binary digits | `Q = A & B` |
| OR | `(...OR...)` | `Q = A + B` | Adding up 2 binary digits | `Q = A OR B` |
| NOT | `~(...)` | `Q = !A` | Flipping the binary bits (finding the 1s complement of a binary number) | `Q = ~A` |
| XOR (Ex-OR) | `(...^...)` | `Q = (!(A) . B) OR (A . ~B)` | Checking if 2 binary digits' bits aren't the same | `(~(A) & B) OR (A & ~B)` |
| N-XOR (NOT-Ex-OR) | `~(...^...)` | `Q = !((!(A) . B) OR (A . ~B))` | Checking if 2 binary digits' bits are the same | `~((~(A) & B) OR (A & ~B))` | 
| N-AND | `~(...&...)` |  `Q = !(A . B)` | State and circuit control when 2 states are true, the result is false and when the two states are false or one of them is false, the result is true | `Q = ~(A & B)` |
| N-OR | `~(...OR...)` | `Q = !(A + B)` | - | `Q = ~(A & B)` |

Here is an example in C:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<inttypes.h>

/** uint8_t is defined as unsigned char */
/**
 * Prints a [substrate] in a new-line with a base radix.
 * 
 * @param substrate an unsigned 8-bit integer to print
 * @param radix the base to use, 2 for binary, 16 for hexadecimal, otherwise the value is evaluated to 10 for decimal
 */
void println(const uint8_t substrate, const uint8_t radix) {
    char* base;
    if (radix == 2) {
        base = (char*) "%b";
    } else if (radix == 16) {
        base = (char*) "%x";
    } else {
        base = (char*) "%d";
    }
    printf(base, substrate);
    printf("\n");
}

int main(void* args) {
    // 6) Bitwise logical operations:
    
    /* -- Principal logic gates -- */
    // (|): Bitwise logical OR, designated by the (+) sign in boolean algebra.
    // (&): Bitwise logical AND, designated by the (.) sign in boolean algebra.
    // (~): Bitwise logical NOT, designated by the dash or the bar (A`) sign in boolean algebra.


    /* -- Combinatorial logic gates -- */
    // (^): Bitwise exclusive OR (XOR), produces Q = 1, if only and only one of the inputs is 1, otherwise produces Q = 0
    // Note: Q = A ^ B is the same as Q = (~(A) & B) | (A & ~B)
    // ~(&): Bitwise logical NAND
    // ~(|): Bitwise logical NOR
    // ~(^): Bitwise logical NXOR, produces Q = 1, if only and only the two inputs are the same (whether they are zero or one), otherwise produces Q = 0 
    // Note: Q = ~(A ^ B) is the same as Q = ~((~(A) & B) | (A & ~B))
    uint8_t inputA = 0b00000011;
    uint8_t inputB = 0b11000000;
    const uint8_t OR_AB = inputA | inputB; /* 0b11000011, usage: concatenates the binary commands into a single command */ 
    println(OR_AB, 2);
    const uint8_t AND_AB = inputA & inputB; /* 0b00000000, usage: compares the binary commands and find if they both are equal to HIGH (1) */
    println(AND_AB, 2);
    const uint8_t XOR_AB = inputA ^ inputB; /* 0b11000011, usage: compares the binary commands and find if they are both equal (Q = 0) or not (Q = 1)*/
    println(XOR_AB, 2);
    const uint8_t NAND_AB = ~AND_AB; /* 0b11111111, usage: */
    println(NAND_AB, 2);
    const uint8_t NOR_AB = ~OR_AB; /* 0b00111100, usage: finds all the non-involved bits in the OR */
    println(NOR_AB, 2);
    const uint8_t NXOR_AB = ~XOR_AB; /* 0b00111100, usage: tests whether the 2 inputs are the same (Q = 1) or not (Q = 0).*/
    println(NXOR_AB, 2);

    /* and so on */

    return 0;
}
```

----------------------

### Bitwise Shifting:

- Shifting operations

| `Operator` | `Notation` | `Name` | `Usage` | `Equivalent maths equation` | `Example` |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `<<` | `BINARY_NUMBER << NUM_OF_SHIFTS` | Left shift | Left shifting bits on (BINARY_NUMBER) by a number of times (NUM_OF_SHIFTS) | `BINARY_NUMBER * pow(2, NUM_OF_SHIFTS)` | `(0b00001110 << 3) is the same as (((0b00001110 << 1) << 1) << 1)` | 
| `>>` | `BINARY_NUMBER >> NUM_OF_SHIFTS` | Right shift | Right shifting bits on (BINARY_NUMBER) by a number of times (NUM_OF_SHIFTS) | `BINARY_NUMBER * pow(2, -NUM_OF_SHIFTS)` | `(0b00111000 >> 3) is the same as (((0b00111000 >> 1) >> 1) >> 1)` | 

- Addition

| `Operation` | `Example 1` | `Example 2` |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 + 0 = 0 | 0b00000000 + 0b00000000 = 0b00000000 | - |
| 0 + 1 = 1 | 0b00000000 + 0b00000001 = 0b00000001 | 0b00001100 + 0b00000011 = 0b00001111 |
| 1 + 1 = 0 and carry 1 | 0b00000001 + 0b00000001 = 0b00000010 | 0b00000100 + 0b00000100 = 0b00000100 * 2 = 0b00000100 * pow(2, 1) = 0b00000100 << 1 = 0b00001000 |

- Subtraction

| `General layout` | `Steps` | `Example 1` | `Example 2` |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Minuend - Subtrahend = Minuend + (-Subtrahend) = Minuend + (1s Complement of Subtrahend + 0b01) = Minuend + (2s Complement of the Subtrahend) | First, find the 2s' complement of the subtrahend, which is the 1s' complement plus one, then add the 2s' complement of the subtrahend to the minuend | 0b00001111 (15) - 0b00000011 (3) = 0b00001111 + (0b11111100 + 0b00000001) = 0b00001111 + 0b11111101 = 0b00001100 (12) | 0b00000010 (2) - 0b00000001 (1) = 0b00000010 + (0b11111111) = 0b00000001 (1) |

Notes: 
- The 1s complement of a binary number is taken by applying a `NOT` gate to the number, ie by flipping bits.
- The 2s complement of a binary number is taken by adding 1 to the 1s complement of that binary number.

Here is an example in C:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<inttypes.h> /* includes the [uint8_t] a short-hand for the unsigned char, an 8-bit unsigned integer */

int main(void* args) {

    // 5) Bitwise operators: Shifting bits and logical operators.
    // left shifting: BINARY << SHIFT_TIMES = BINARY * Math.pow(2, SHIFT_TIMES)
    uint8_t x = (1 << 0b00000001) /*0b00000010*/ | (1/*0b0001*/ << 0b00000011 /*3*/) /*0b00001000*/; /*0b01010*/ /* 10 */
    uint8_t y = (0b00000001 << 1) /*0b00000010*/ | (0b00000011 << 1) /*0b00000110*/; /*0b00000110*/ /* 6 */
    
    // right shifting: BINARY >> SHIFT_TIMES  = BINARY * Math.pow(2, -SHIFT_TIMES)
    uint8_t testRightShifting = (0b00001000 >> 3); /* 0b0001 = 1*/
    uint8_t testLeftShifting = (0b00001000 << 3); /* 0b0001000000 = 64*/

    // TIPs to minimize errors: the BINARY value should be your lvalue.

    return 0;
} 
```
