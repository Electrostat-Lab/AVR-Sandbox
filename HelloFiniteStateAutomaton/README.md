# Finite-State-Automata

## Definition:
A finite-state machine (or finite automaton) is an abstract model describing
the synchronous sequential machine and its spatial counterpart, the iterative
network.


## Usages:
- It is the basis for the understanding and development of the vari-
ous computation structures.
- The basic unit of the sequential and combinational logic output.

## Example (State diagram for the serial adder):


## Example to the API implementation:
