## Avr-Data-Types

An example demonstrates the available data types in avr-gnu lib.

Topics covered: 
- Different integer data types (uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint32_t) and their equivalent compound types.
- UART printing strings and integers.
- Converting integers to strings.
- Bitwise operations.
- Principal and combinatoric logic gates (and their equivalent gates).
- Allocating and deallocating pointers (buffers) before use.
- Some strings utility functions.
