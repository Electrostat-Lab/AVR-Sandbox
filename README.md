This repository lists down some useful testcases and common logical algorithms using `AVR-CORE` that are widely used in the field of hardware development and embedded systems.

The testcases directrly access the `atmega` registers ports and their individual pins.

## General Block Diagram for AVR Architecture parts: 

The General block diagram for the MCU architecture is a great tool that guides towards the existing protocols and this mcu features that you could implement.
