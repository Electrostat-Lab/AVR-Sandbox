> [!WARNING]
> Archived as Read-only. The repository has been migrated to the [Electrostatics-Sandbox](https://github.com/Electrostat-Lab/Electrostatic-Sandbox), a work-in-progress complete SDK suite for distributed simulation systems based on the IEEE-1516 HLA Software Architecture Specification and NASA DSES.

This repository lists down some useful testcases and common logical algorithms using `AVR-CORE` that are widely used in the field of hardware development and embedded systems.

The testcases directrly access the `atmega` registers ports and their individual pins.

## General Block Diagram for AVR Architecture parts: 

The General block diagram for the MCU architecture is a great tool that guides towards the existing protocols and this mcu features that you could implement.
