# AVR-Sandbox

This repository lists down some useful testcases and common logical algorithms using `AVR-CORE` that are widely used in the field of hardware development and embedded systems, 
we will work on `arduino-nano` which is based on `atmega328p` also plain atmega is supported.

The testcases directrly access the `atmega328p`'s registers ports and their individual pins.

## Atmega328p arduino-nano ports :
