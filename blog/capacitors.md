`Q <Charge in coloumb> = C <Capacitance in Farads> x V <Voltage in volt>`
`C = Q / V`

A Capacitor is a basic electronic component that stores electric charges (Q) based on the supplied voltage (V) and the Capacitance value (C).

Capacitance is a value calculated in Farads designating the amount of the charge that a capacitor can accumulate over its plates per the supplied voltage.

Both the capacitance and the supplied voltage (the work in joules) scale the final electric charge that is stored across the plates of the capacitor.

The physical constituents of a capacitor are listed here: 

1) The dielectric is composed of 2 parallel electric plates.

2) Connecting Leads.

3) An insulator covering.
