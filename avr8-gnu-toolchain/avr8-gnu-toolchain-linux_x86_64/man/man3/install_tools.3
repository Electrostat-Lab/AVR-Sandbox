install_tools \- Building and Installing the GNU Tool Chain 
.PP
This chapter shows how to build and install, from source code, a complete development environment for the AVR processors using the GNU toolset. There are two main sections, one for Linux, FreeBSD, and other Unix-like operating systems, and another section for Windows.
.SH "Building and Installing under Linux, FreeBSD, and Others"
.PP
The default behaviour for most of these tools is to install every thing under the \fC/usr/local\fP directory. In order to keep the AVR tools separate from the base system, it is usually better to install everything into \fC/usr/local/avr\fP. If the \fC/usr/local/avr\fP directory does not exist, you should create it before trying to install anything. You will need \fCroot\fP access to install there. If you don't have root access to the system, you can alternatively install in your home directory, for example, in \fC$HOME/local/avr\fP. Where you install is a completely arbitrary decision, but should be consistent for all the tools.
.PP
You specify the installation directory by using the \fC--prefix=dir\fP option with the \fCconfigure\fP script. It is important to install all the AVR tools in the same directory or some of the tools will not work correctly. To ensure consistency and simplify the discussion, we will use \fC$PREFIX\fP to refer to whatever directory you wish to install in. You can set this as an environment variable if you wish as such (using a Bourne-like shell):
.PP
  
.PP
.nf

$ PREFIX=$HOME/local/avr
$ export PREFIX

.fi
.PP
.PP
  
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
Be sure that you have your \fCPATH\fP environment variable set to search the directory you install everything in \fIbefore\fP you start installing anything. For example, if you use \fC--prefix=$PREFIX\fP, you must have \fC$PREFIX/bin\fP in your exported \fCPATH\fP. As such:
.RE
.PP
.PP
.nf

$ PATH=$PATH:$PREFIX/bin
$ export PATH
.fi
.PP
.PP
\fBWarning:\fP
.RS 4
If you have \fCCC\fP set to anything other than \fCavr-gcc\fP in your environment, this will cause the configure script to fail. It is best to not have \fCCC\fP set at all.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote:\fP

It is usually the best to use the latest released version of each of the tools.

.SH "GNU Binutils for the AVR target"
.PP
.PP
The \fC\fBbinutils\fP\fP package provides all the low-level utilities needed in building and manipulating object files. Once installed, your environment will have an AVR assembler (\fCavr-as\fP), linker (\fCavr-ld\fP), and librarian (\fCavr-ar\fP and \fCavr-ranlib\fP). In addition, you get tools which extract data from object files (\fCavr-objcopy\fP), dissassemble object file information (\fCavr-objdump\fP), and strip information from object files (\fCavr-strip\fP). Before we can build the C compiler, these tools need to be in place.
.PP
Download and unpack the source files:
.PP
.PP
.nf

$ bunzip2 -c binutils-<version>.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
$ cd binutils-<version>
.fi
.PP
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
Replace \fC<version>\fP with the version of the package you downloaded.
.PP
If you obtained a gzip compressed file (.gz), use \fCgunzip\fP instead of \fCbunzip2\fP.
.RE
.PP
It is usually a good idea to configure and build \fC\fBbinutils\fP\fP in a subdirectory so as not to pollute the source with the compiled files. This is recommended by the \fC\fBbinutils\fP\fP developers.
.PP
.PP
.nf

$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr
.fi
.PP
.PP
The next step is to configure and build the tools. This is done by supplying arguments to the \fCconfigure\fP script that enable the AVR-specific options.
.PP
.PP
.nf

$ ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX --target=avr --disable-nls
.fi
.PP
.PP
If you don't specify the \fC--prefix\fP option, the tools will get installed in the \fC/usr/local\fP hierarchy (i.e. the binaries will get installed in \fC/usr/local/bin\fP, the info pages get installed in \fC/usr/local/info\fP, etc.) Since these tools are changing frequently, It is preferrable to put them in a location that is easily removed.
.PP
When \fCconfigure\fP is run, it generates a lot of messages while it determines what is available on your operating system. When it finishes, it will have created several \fCMakefile\fPs that are custom tailored to your platform. At this point, you can build the project.
.PP
.PP
.nf

$ make
.fi
.PP
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
BSD users should note that the project's \fCMakefile\fP uses GNU \fCmake\fP syntax. This means FreeBSD users may need to build the tools by using \fCgmake\fP.
.RE
.PP
If the tools compiled cleanly, you're ready to install them. If you specified a destination that isn't owned by your account, you'll need \fCroot\fP access to install them. To install:
.PP
.PP
.nf

$ make install
.fi
.PP
.PP
You should now have the programs from binutils installed into \fC$PREFIX/bin\fP. Don't forget to \fBset your PATH\fP environment variable before going to build avr-gcc.

.RE

The steps to build \fCavr-gcc\fP are essentially same as for \fBbinutils\fP:
.PP
.PP
.nf

$ bunzip2 -c gcc-<version>.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
$ cd gcc-<version>
$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr

.PP
To save your self some download time, you can alternatively download only the \fCgcc-core-<version>.tar.bz2\fP and \fCgcc-c++-<version>.tar.bz2\fP parts of the gcc. Also, if you don't need C++ support, you only need the core part and should only enable the C language support. (Starting with GCC 4.7 releases, these split files are no longer available though.)
.PP
\fBNote:\fP

To build and install avr-libc:
.PP
.PP

$ make
$ make install
.fi
.PP
.PP
where \fCDEBUG_INFO\fP can be one of \fCstabs\fP, \fCdwarf-2\fP, or \fCdwarf-4\fP.
.PP
The default is to not generate any debug information, which is suitable for binary distributions of avr-libc, where the user does not have the source code installed the debug information would refer to.

\fC\fBavrdude\fP\fP is part of the FreeBSD ports system. To install it, simply do the following:
.PP
.PP
.nf

# cd /usr/ports/devel/avrdude
# make install
.fi
.PP
.PP
\fBNote:\fP

Installation into the default location usually requires root permissions. However, running the program only requires access permissions to the appropriate \fCppi(4)\fP device.

Building and installing on other systems should use the \fCconfigure\fP system, as such:
.PP
.PP
.nf

$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr

.PP
.PP
\fBNote:\fP

.PP
.PP
\fBNote:\fP

AVaRICE uses the BFD library for accessing various binary file formats. You may need to tell the configure script where to find the lib and headers for the link to work. This is usually done by invoking the configure script like this (Replace \fC<hdr_path>\fP with the path to the \fCbfd.h\fP file on your system. Replace \fC<lib_path>\fP with the path to \fClibbfd.a\fP on your system.):

.SH "Building and Installing under Windows"
.PP
Building and installing the toolchain under Windows requires more effort because all of the tools required for building, and the programs themselves, are mainly designed for running under a POSIX environment such as Unix and Linux. Windows does not natively provide such an environment.
.PP
There are two projects available that provide such an environment, Cygwin and MinGW. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Cygwin provides a very complete POSIX environment that allows one to build many Linux based tools from source with very little or no source modifications. However, POSIX functionality is provided in the form of a DLL that is linked to the application. This DLL has to be redistributed with your application and there are issues if the Cygwin DLL already exists on the installation system and different versions of the DLL. On the other hand, MinGW can compile code as native Win32 applications. However, this means that programs designed for Unix and Linux (i.e. that use POSIX functionality) will not compile as MinGW does not provide that POSIX layer for you. Therefore most programs that compile on both types of host systems, usually must provide some sort of abstraction layer to allow an application to be built cross-platform.
.PP
MinGW does provide somewhat of a POSIX environment, called MSYS, that allows you to build Unix and Linux applications as they woud normally do, with a \fCconfigure\fP step and a \fCmake\fP step. Cygwin also provides such an environment. This means that building the AVR toolchain is very similar to how it is built in Linux, described above. The main differences are in what the PATH environment variable gets set to, pathname differences, and the tools that are required to build the projects under Windows. We'll take a look at the tools next.
.SH "Tools Required for Building the Toolchain for Windows"
.PP
These are the tools that are currently used to build an AVR tool chain. This list may change, either the version of the tools, or the tools themselves, as improvements are made.
