     * @note The pointer is of single size of a type.
     * @note The pointer points to only and only one buffer at a time.
     * @note New buffers can be added to this pointer by dereferencing it and adding one to the memory address to move 
     * it to a new cell block.
     * e.g: 
     * 1) First way of adding a new buffer to this pointer using the deep copy:
     *     buffer[index] = (void*) calloc(1, sizeof(void*));
     *     buffer[index] = item;
     * 
     * 2) Second way of adding a new buffer to this pointer (the one used here):
     *     *(buffer += count) = (void*) calloc(1, sizeof(void*));
     *     *buffer = item;
     *     buffer -= count;
     *
